**From a problem to a program**
The first step will be to clearly define the problem.
Then you create an algorithm, a sequence of steps that will lead to a solution of the problem. You can do this in your //natural// language.
Then you transform the algorithm in a program, a sequence of instructions in a language that the computer can understand.
Then you run the program.
